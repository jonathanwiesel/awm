# Todo

* Add tests
* Support *real* install workflow (not download and open `.alfredworkflow` file).
* Support *real* upgrade workflows (not download and open `.alfredworkflow` file).
* Support upgrade ALL outdated.
* ~~Support remove workflows.~~
* Support `bundle` installing.

Note: one thing to consider when implementing *real* install and update is the previous stripping and migration of hotkeys and keywords.

# Development

Pull requests are happily accepted. I have little time to finish the TODO list for the moment.

To link the `awm` command for development you'll need to fork and clone this project:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/awm
```

Then make `npm` link the `awm` command to the local project destination:

```sh
$ cd awm
awm$ npm link
```

This way you can invoke the `awm` command in the shell reflecting your local work.

If you wish to unlink from the local project:

```sh
$ npm r awm -g
```

> I know, `unlink` should do the trick but no. (https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4005)
